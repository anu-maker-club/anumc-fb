# anumc-fb

Takes various text snippets and formats them into the newsletter format for consistency.
May also be used later if we have an email newsletter in addition to an FB one.

Runs entirely client-side (i.e. in a browser)

## Usage

Enter the current newsletter issue number, and any announcements/special content.
For regular columns, enter them into the fields after "Regular Columns" with title in
the single-line input box and content in the textarea. After clicking Format, cut and
paste the contents of the bottom-most textarea.
